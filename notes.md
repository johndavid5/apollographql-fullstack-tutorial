> Building your frontend with React is not a requirement for using the Apollo platform,
> but it is the primary view layer supported by Apollo. If you use another view layer
> (such as Angular or Vue), you can still apply this tutorial's concepts to it.

> Every graph API is centered around its schema.  You can think of a schema as a bluepring that
> describes all of your data's types and their relationships.  A schema also defines what data we can
> fetch through queries and what data we can update through mutations.  It is strongly typed, which
> unlocks powerful developer tooling.
>
> Schemas are at their best when they are designed around the needs of the clients that are
> consuming them.  Since a schema sits between your clients and your underlying services, it
> serves as a perfect middle ground for frontend and backend teams to collaborate.  We recommend
> that teams practics *Schema First Development* and agree upon the schema first before any API
> development begins.
